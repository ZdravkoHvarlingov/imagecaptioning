The **Preprocessor** expects embedding text file in the format:
-   \<WORD> \<num>, \<num>, ..., \<num>
-   the number of numbers depends on the embedding size
-   each new line represents a new word and its embedding
-   hence a custom embedding model can be implemented as soon as its output follows this format
